<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [download the project](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-responsive-design/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone and [run the project locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-responsive-design#clone--run-locally) to get hands-on practice with the core concepts below.

### Core Concepts

- CSS - Selector Lists & Compound Selectors
- Containers - Floats, Grid & Flexbox
- Media Queries - Mobile First Development
- Inspect Tools - Viewing Layouts in the Browser

### Review & Practice

Start in the practice folder, and after reviewing the code and comments in each file, try styling the elements to match the screenshots shown above. Next, [import a different font style from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and double the number of cards in each container. You can use as many rows as you'd like for tablets, but make sure each container only has one row when viewed on a larger screen, and one column when viewed on a mobile device. Floats can be tricky to work with, so you can follow the resources here or use the hint to practice searching and apply a different solution!

## Build a Mini Project

Once you complete the challenges you'll be able to use your new float, grid, and flexbox skills to build a fully responsive layout from scratch! Find a website you like and use the box model and your browser inspect tools to build a layout representing the home page. The starter files are in the project folder.

If you run into trouble, you can reach out in the #100Devs [[❓code-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channel on Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you have!

## Clone & Run Locally

1. Open the terminal in your code editor and type (or copy/paste):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-responsive-design
   ```

   - _**NOTE:** You can also click the green code button and copy the url (make sure HTTPS is selected)_

2. Navigate to the project folder

   ```
   cd html-css-responsive-design
   ```

You are now able to access and run the project locally.
