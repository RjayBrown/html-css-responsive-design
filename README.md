<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [download the project](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-responsive-design/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or fork and [run the project locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-responsive-design#fork--run-locally) to get hands-on practice with the core concepts below. Start with reviewing the code and comments for each file in the practice folder.

### Core Concepts

- CSS - Selector Lists & Compound Selectors
- Containers - Floats, Grid & Flexbox
- Media Queries - Mobile First Development
- Inspect Tools - Viewing Layouts in the Browser

### Hands-On Practice

**1.** Try styling the elements to match the screenshots shown above.

**2.** Import a different font style from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

**3.** Try to double the number of cards in each container. You can use as many rows as you'd like for tablets, but make sure each container only has one row when viewed on a larger screen, and one column when viewed on a mobile device. Floats can be tricky to work with, so you can follow the resources here or use the hint in the comments to practice searching and applying a different solution!

## Build a Mini-Project

Once you complete the challenges you'll be able to use your new float, grid, and flexbox skills to build a fully responsive layout from scratch! Find a website you like and use the box model and your browser inspect tools to build a layout representing the home page (add text content too if you'd like!). The starter files are in the project folder.

If you run into trouble, you can reach out in the [[üïí catchup-crew]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/932892279637700658) or [[‚ùìcode-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channels in the #100Devs Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you may have!
